gitCommitMsg: 'fix(core): correctly configure build and externals'
promptSummary: >-
  User reported that the previous fix for e2e tests was not effective. This
  applies a more robust fix by both correcting module paths in
  `relaycode-core/package.json` and marking `apply-multi-diff` as external in
  its `tsup` config to prevent bundling issues.
reasoning:
  - >-
    My bad, my last fix didn't cut it. Module resolution can be a real pain.
    After digging deeper, I think I've got the full picture. The problem is a
    combo of two things: how `relaycode-core` is packaged and how it handles its
    dependency on `apply-multi-diff`.
  - >-
    First, the `.mjs` vs `.js` extension issue in
    `packages/relaycode-core/package.json` was a real problem, so I'm
    re-applying that fix. `tsup` generates `.js` for ESM files when `type:
    "module"` is set, so the `package.json` needs to match that.
  - >-
    Second, `tsup` bundles dependencies by default. This can sometimes lead to
    weird issues, especially with module formats. The symptoms you're seeing
    (patching functions not behaving correctly) strongly suggest that the
    bundled version of `apply-multi-diff` inside `relaycode-core` is broken
    somehow.
  - >-
    To fix this for good, I'll tell `tsup` to treat `apply-multi-diff` as an
    external package. This means it won't be bundled in. Instead, the final
    `relaycode-core` build will contain a normal `import ... from
    'apply-multi-diff'`, and the runtime (Bun) will resolve it from
    `node_modules` like any other package. This is way more robust.
  - Here are the two patches to get this done.
  - >-
    First, let's fix the module paths in `relaycode-core`'s `package.json`
    again.
  - >-
    Second, let's update the `tsup` config to exclude `apply-multi-diff` from
    the bundle.
  - >-
    This two-part fix should resolve the module weirdness and get your tests
    back to green.
