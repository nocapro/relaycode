relaycode:

I want when running relay -v
its not only show relaycode version

`
relay -v
1.1.5
`

but also last modified dateTime of packages and beautiful ascii exatcly like this

```

  ░█▀▄░█▀▀░█░░░█▀█░█░█░█▀▀░█▀█░█▀▄░█▀▀
  ░█▀▄░█▀▀░█░░░█▀█░░█░░█░░░█░█░█░█░█▀▀
  ░▀░▀░▀▀▀░▀▀▀░▀░▀░░▀░░▀▀▀░▀▀▀░▀▀░░▀▀▀

  relaycode version 1.1.5

  last modified source code

  relaycode            2011-11-04 00:05:23
  relaycode-core       2011-11-04 00:05:23
  apply-multi-diff     2011-11-04 00:05:23
  konro                2011-11-04 00:05:23

```

Pay attention;

1. the datetime should be get from index files

src/index.ts
packages/konro/src/index.ts
packages/apply-multi-diff/src/index.ts
packages/relaycode-core/src/index.ts

2. datetime should auto updated to each index files on every user `bun run build` command while user run it within individual packages. so you need to create scripts to konro, apply-multi-diff, relaycode-core, relaycode

so now on relay -v command user can now which build source code the deps use

can you make below terminal UI more cohesive? less redundant thing also.

Reasoning:
  Here are the modifications to give your hero section an amazing animated background. I've refactored the layout slightly to allow for a full-width background on the hero while keeping other sections constrained.
  ### Step 1: Remove Global Animated Background and Refactor Layout
  First, I'll remove the existing full-page animated background from `App.tsx` and take the `container` class off the `main` element. This will allow the `Hero` section to span the full width of the viewport.
  ### Step 2: Constrain Content in Standard Sections
  Next, I'll update the generic `Section` component to include the `container` class. This ensures all other sections maintain their centered, max-width layout.
  ### Step 3: Create the Animated Hero Background Component
  I'll create a new `HeroBackground` component. This will render a subtle grid of dots with a beautiful, slowly panning aurora-like gradient.
  ### Step 4: Integrate the New Background into the Hero Section
  Finally, I'll refactor the `Hero` component. It will now be a full-width `section` containing the new `HeroBackground`. The original content is wrapped in a `container` div to keep it centered, preserving the two-column layout.

Reasoning:
  Of course. The dot grid was barely visible due to low color contrast, and it wasn't animated. I'll fix both issues to make the background more dynamic and visually appealing.
  ### Step 1: Add Dot Grid Animation to Tailwind Config
  First, I'll add a new keyframe animation to `tailwind.config.cjs`. This `dot-grid-pan` animation will create a slow, continuous scrolling effect for the dot grid, making it feel more alive.
  ### Step 2: Update Hero Background Component
  Next, I'll update the `HeroBackground` component. I'm swapping the nearly-invisible dot color with a more visible (but still subtle) shade from your theme (`muted-foreground` with 20% opacity). I'll also apply the new `animate-dot-grid-pan` class to bring it to life.
  These changes will make the dot grid clearly visible and add a gentle, looping animation for a more polished and dynamic hero section.

on every transaction process should ask user whether to approve or reject the transaction. not just asking for approve-all

also current UI terminal is so noisy

should not wait for user approval if there is another upcoming clipboard to parse, we have bulk user approval feature right??

lib user reporting this, so please fix the problem also guardrail with e2e test cases. give me transaction in two phase. now give me the first phase

1. bug: after rolled back transaction, stopping the relay watch, then start relay watch again, the same transaction from clipboard got applied again

rolled back transaction should be marked as rolled back in status

2. default db format should be yaml, not json.
3. the correct transaction path should be .relay/transaction not .relay/db/transaction
4. you should guardrails above behaviours using e2e test cases

give me transaction in three phase. now give me the first phase

create path sanitizer feature, example

Found 3 errors.

error: "tsc" exited with code 1 (SIGHUP)

===

make the codebase radically DRY less code no redundancy without causing regression or fail tests

===

beside insertion and deletion stats, also add difference count

===

update system prompt based on latest multi-diff-apply

===

   ```yaml
   projectId: test-project
   uuid: 267e8262-f32c-4672-bd69-c838d26f5607
   changeSummary: [{"new":"file1.ts"}]
   gitCommitMsg: "feat: first commit"
   ```

   that is look like a json than yaml. refactor

=== DONE

on multiple transactionsbefore git commit, user want relay git commit , but should auto merge all commit message into one from many transactions. also add test cases about that git commit

===

split relaycode test fixtures to multiple files just like in apply-multi-diff... also add more cases to battle test

===

refactor relaycode , because apply-multi-diff is only have 2 strategy and no new unified or something naming, only StandardDiff and SearchReplace.. see its readme.md

===

refactor relaycode to use relaycode-core , and relaycode-core should use apply-multi-diff. which one first? relaycode-core first todo?

give me transaction in 3 phase. now give me the first phase

===

understand docs/separation.report.md well, then execute the implementation of separating relaycoder core to another npm package.

===

analayse about `separating relaycoder core to another npm package` . then give me the concise report. do not give me any code.
